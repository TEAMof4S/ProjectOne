## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8+ recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TEAMof4S/ProjectOne.git
cd TEAMof4S_yearproject1
```

## Installation

This project is divided into two parts: `backend` (Flask) and `frontend` (Vue + Vite). You will need to set up both.

### Backend role ONLY

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Ensure your requirements file is named correctly. If you encounter issues, check if the file is named `requirements.txt ` with a trailing space and rename it if necessary.)*

### Frontend role ONLY

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   # Or from the root: cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Backend
In your backend terminal (with virtual environment activated):
```bash
python app.py
```
The backend server should start, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Running the Frontend
In your frontend terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The development server will start (check the terminal for the localhost URL, usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL to view the application.
